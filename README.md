# Hate Speech Detection and Paraphrase

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation for hate speech detection and paraphrase analysis.

## Project Description

The project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data and includes functionality for paraphrase detection. This is a machine learning-based approach to identify potentially harmful content.

## Files

- `hate_speecch_detetction_2 (3).ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the hate speech detection implementation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment
3. Install required dependencies (check the notebook for specific requirements)
4. Run the cells in the notebook

## Requirements

The specific requirements will be listed in the notebook, but typically include:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Usage

Open the notebook and follow the instructions within to:
- Load and preprocess data
- Train hate speech detection models
- Evaluate model performance
- Perform paraphrase analysis
